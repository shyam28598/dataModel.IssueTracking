notesPrevious:
  These data models allow to perform civic issue tracking. They have been designed
  with a view to enabling trivial interoperability between FIWARE NGSI version 2 and
  NGSI-LD and [Open311](http://www.open311.org/). As a result, property names have not
  been normalized to the `camelCase`syntax, they remain as currently specified by
  Open311. That is the rationale behind naming entity types with `Open311` as
  prefix. However, a few properties are added, so that FIWARE NGSI version 2
  implementations can properly store and serve Open 311 data.

  In the medium term, might propose to the Open311 Community a harmonized data model
  aligned with the rest of smart data models and schema.org. In fact, using these
  data models and a FIWARE NGSI version 2 o rNGSI-LD implementation it is trivial
  to implement the APIs proposed by Open311. Another option would be the use of
  [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org) to define equivalencies and mappings between a
  FIWARE / Schema.org data model and Open 311.
